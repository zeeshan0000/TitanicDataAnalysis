# TitanicDataAnalysis
This repository contains a data analysis project based on the famous Titanic dataset, which consists of data on passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and others.
