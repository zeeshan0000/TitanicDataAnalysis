# Titanic Data Analysis Repository
This repository contains a data analysis project based on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information on passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and others. The Titanic dataset is widely used in data science as an introductory dataset for demonstrating predictive modeling and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# Project Breakdown
Data Collection & Cleaning:
The Titanic dataset contains several missing values, categorical variables, and potential outliers. During the preprocessing stage, the following steps are applied to clean the data:

# Imputation: 
Missing values are filled in for columns such as Age and Fare based on the median values of the respective columns.
Feature Encoding: Categorical variables such as Sex and Embarked are encoded using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding to make them suitable for machine learning models.

# Data Preparation: 
The dataset is cleaned by ensuring that the test data matches the training data in terms of features and handling missing values efficiently.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is conducted to gain a better understanding of the dataset. The key steps include:

Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics are generated for numeric features to understand their distribution and identify any anomalies.

Visualizations: Various plots (e.g., bar charts, histograms, and box plots) are used to examine survival rates, feature relationships (like age, sex, class), and feature distributions.

Insights: EDA provides insights into factors that influence survival, which aids in feature selection for building predictive models.

# 3. Feature Engineering:
In this step, relevant features are identified and new ones are created to enhance model performance:

Feature Selection: Features such as Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked are chosen based on their potential influence on survival.
Additional Features: New features, such as Title (derived from passenger names), are created to capture additional information related to the social status of passengers.

# 4. Machine Learning Models:
Several classification models are implemented to predict passenger survival:

Random Forest Classifier: A robust ensemble model is trained on the dataset and evaluated.
Logistic Regression: A simpler model is used for comparison.
Decision Trees: Another model is implemented to assess its performance.
These models are trained on the dataset and evaluated based on key metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score

# 5. Model Evaluation & Tuning:
The repository also includes steps for:

Model Evaluation: Evaluation of the performance of different models on a test set to determine their effectiveness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning of model hyperparameters to improve performance using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.

# 6. Submission:
Once the model is trained and evaluated, the predictions are made for the test dataset, and the results are saved in a submission.csv file. This file contains the PassengerId and the predicted survival (Survived) for each passenger.
