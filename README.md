# TitanicDataAnalysis
Titanic Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains a data analysis project based on the famous Titanic dataset, which consists of data on passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and others. The Titanic dataset is widely used for data science projects to demonstrate the process of building predictive models and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# Project Breakdown:

Data Collection & Cleaning: The dataset contains missing values, categorical variables, and potential outliers, which are handled during the preprocessing stage. Techniques such as imputation for missing data, feature encoding for categorical variables, and scaling for numerical features are applied to prepare the data for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

Initial analysis focuses on exploring patterns and trends within the dataset. Key steps include generating summary statistics, creating visualizations to examine survival rates, and understanding the relationship between features such as age, gender, class, and survival. EDA helps in gaining insights that guide the feature selection process for machine learning models.

# Feature Engineering: 
In this step, relevant features are identified, and new ones are created to improve model performance. For instance, the 'Title' column is extracted from the name to distinguish between different social statuses of passengers.

Machine Learning Models: Multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, are implemented to predict passenger survival. The models are trained on the dataset, and their performances are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Model Evaluation & Tuning: 

The repository includes detailed steps for model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

# Project Objective: 
The Titanic Data Analysis project demonstrates the full cycle of data science, from data cleaning to building and evaluating machine learning models. It is an excellent resource for beginners and those looking to sharpen their skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.
